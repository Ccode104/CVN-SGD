# CVN-SGD: Curvature-aware Variance-Normalized SGD
A Theoretical and Empirical Analysis for Robust Gradient Optimization

This repository contains the LaTeX source files, final PDF reports, and the Colab notebook developed during our study on improving Gradient Descent (GD).  
Our work focuses on analyzing existing optimization techniques and proposing **CVN-SGD**, an improved variant particularly effective on **anisotropic data**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

- Studied existing GD enhancements through a detailed literature survey.  
- Derived a curvature-aware, variance-normalized update rule using textbook theorems and lemmas.  
- Implemented both **Standard GD** and **CVN-SGD** for comparison.  
- Ran experiments and generated plots to evaluate performance gains.  
- Prepared an IEEE-style report documenting theory, methodology, and empirical results.
